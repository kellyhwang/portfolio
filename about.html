		<div id="detailed-about">
			<p>I am currnently attending University of Southern California working towards a BFA in Design. I like to focus on branding in the graphic design industry. I also have been trying to explore UIUX design with a some simple computer languages. During my free time, I enjoy taking film photos with people and places that I love or have visited. Film photos are a fun way to connect with people and a clever way to have some permanent memories!</p>
			<p>Much Love, Kelly</p>
